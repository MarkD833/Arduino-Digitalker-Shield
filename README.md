# Arduino UNO National Semiconductor Digitalker Shield
I recently discovered a National Semiconductor DIGITALKER IC in my collection. This one is packaged in a yellow
box supplied by RS Componenets in the UK. I also have 2 of the DIGITALKER speech ROMS.

Now I'm more confident with using Eagle PCB (v7.7) and producing gerbers for JLCPCB I figured I'd have a go
at producing a DIGITALKER shield for an Arduino UNO.
