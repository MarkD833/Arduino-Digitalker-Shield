Here you will find the various datasheets associated with the Digitalker chip that I have found.

 There's also a PDF document called DVSS_Adventures_v1.1. This document forms some of my early work on figuring out how the DVSS software suite works. It's now out of date and all my latest findings etc are in a [separate repository here](https://github.com/MarkD833/Digitalker-Digital-Voice-Selection-Software) including the ROMs I've created to hold all of the vocabulary supplied as part of the DVSS software suite.
